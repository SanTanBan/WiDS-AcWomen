We are team AcWomen (ranked 53 in the final Public Leaderboard. and ranked 222 in the final Private Leaderboard).

This repository contains the files for replicating the radar graphs used to represent the varying hyperparameter values.
The actual values of the hyperparameters, as obtained from Optuna, are used in the notebooks in this repository to develop the radar graphs for each model.
The mappings and Min-Max scaling factors are also available within the notebooks.
